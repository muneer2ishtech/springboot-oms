# springboot-oms

The owner's standing instructions are in `.claude/rules/` (`owner-workflow.md`, `git-and-branches.md`, `versions-and-releases.md`, `build-and-test.md`, `build-tooling.md`, `documentation.md`, `repositories.md`). They apply to every task in this repo. This file adds only what is specific to this repo.

## About this repo
- It's a runnable Spring Boot application, so it has test Levels 1, 2 and 3.
- It's built with Maven (`pom.xml`); use `./mvnw`.
- Nothing depends on `springboot-oms`, so dependent tests (`rules/build-and-test.md`, section "Dependent tests") don't apply.
- Upstream libraries: `ishtech-springboot-jwtauth`, and its own upstream libraries (`rules/repositories.md`). Its version is declared in `pom.xml`; these are the upstream SNAPSHOTs that the test Level 3 precondition refers to.

## Read the doc before doing the thing
The docs are the source of truth. Don't guess commands: open the matching file and section first, and follow its links.

| Before you... | Read |
|---|---|
| work out what the application is and its tech stack | `README.md`, the introduction and sections "Tech stack" and "Design" |
| run test Level 1 (build with tests) | `README.md`, section "Build and Run", subsection "Local Maven Build" |
| check the default JDK version or the other supported JDK versions | `README.md`, section "Tech stack"; which application version and Docker image tag belong to which JDK version, `JDK-VERSIONS.md`; for the `dev-jdkNN` branches and their releases, `rules/versions-and-releases.md`, section "JDK variants" |
| run test Level 2 (run the app with Maven) | `README.md`, section "Build and Run", subsection "Local Maven Run". The app needs its database set up first: `DB-SETUP.md`, section "Local" |
| run test Level 3 (run with Docker compose) | `DOCKER-BUILD.md`, section "Run with docker compose" |
| run the API tests (part of Levels 2 and 3) | `CURL-INFO.md` (every flow; the auth flows are in the ishtech-springboot-jwtauth doc linked under "Auth APIs"); endpoint list in `API-INFO.md` |
| touch the database for any other reason | `DB-SETUP.md` |
| change the version or anything release-related, or check what CI enforces | `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` |
| report or fix a bug | `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` first, it may already be recorded |

If a doc is missing, wrong or unclear, fix the doc (see `rules/documentation.md`) instead of working around it.
